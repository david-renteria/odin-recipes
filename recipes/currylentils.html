<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Rince rice thoroughly 203 times, or until water runs almost clear.</li>
    <li>Add water and butter to cooking device (e.g. rice cooker).</li>
    <li>Set aside, but don't start cooking the rice yet.</li>
    <li>Saute mirepoix mix for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
    <li>Add curry powder and cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
    <li>Add lentils and vegetable broth, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Start cooking the rice.</li>
    <li>Once the lentils are done cooking, remove lid and add the coconut milk, red pepper flakes, and salt. Then cook for an additional 10 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>
    <li>Pre-heat oven to 400F.</li>
    <li>The lentils and rice should finish cooking around the same time. Once finished, stir/fluff, then set aside.</li>
    <li>Once the oven is done pre-heating, add a garlic naan slice and bake for 3-3.5 minutes (or longer if you prefer crunchier naan).</li>
    <li>After the garlic naan is finished, everything is ready to be served!</li>
